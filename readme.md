# auth frontend example 
In this example we connected frontend to backend. We implemented the following functionality: 
- Login and get a token
- Make a request to `/api/products/list`  
## Getting Started

- Set up the .env file with the database connection (use `env.example`) + your JWT secret
- Run the following command to install modules: 
   - > `npm i`
   - > `cd client && npm i`
- Starting the server 
   - > `npm run dev`

- Starting client (in a second terminal)
   - > `cd client && npm start`
